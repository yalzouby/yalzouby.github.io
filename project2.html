                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <div>
                    <h6>Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated
                        17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Four out of 5CVD
                        deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in
                        people under 70 years of age. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset
                        contains 11 features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease.

                        People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence
                        of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already
                        established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be
                        of great help. Through this analysis, we will implement a model that will allow us to
                        predict who is at risk of heart disease based off of their heart features.</h6>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h6>For this analysis, I will be using the <a
                            href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction/data">"Heart

                        Kaggle, which is a combination of several other independent datasets. The dataset features 11
                        common heart disease predicters for 918 observations as well as a heart disease attribute. Seven
                        of the attributes are categorical:</h6>

                <h4>Pre-processing</h4>
                <div>
                    <h6>To prepare the dataset for processing, we'll first make sure it has no null or duplicated
                        values. While KNN is sensitive to outliers, we will still refrain from removing any outliers for
                        the numerical attributes. Outliers in this context represent the serious health conditions that
                        could decide whether or not a person is at risk of heart disease.</h6>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h6>Later on, we will use a LabelEncoder to change the categorical values into numerical values so
                        that we can use a predictor model.</h6>
                </div>
                <h4>Data Understanding & Visualization</h4>
                <div>
                    <h6>We'll start off by ensuring our dataset is balanced so our model doesn't train on a biased
                        dataset. Using seaborn's countplot, we can plot the distribution of the heart disease
                        attribute, which will be our response variable.</h6>
                </div>
                <div class="project">
                    <img src="images/P2HeartDiseaseCountplot.png" alt="Heart Disease Countplot">
                    <div class="text">
                        <p class="description"> Figure 1: Distribution of Heart Disease Risk</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h6>The plot shows that the dataset is fairly balanced with 508 people having a risk of heart
                        disease and 410 people not having a risk of heart disease.
                        Let's compare this distribution to the rest of the variables' distributions by creating
                        subplots. We'll use histograms for numeric variables and bar plots for categorical variables,
                        ensuring all variables are visualized appropriately.</h6>
                </div>
                <div class="project">
                    <img src="images/P2FeaturesDistributions.png" alt="Heart Features' Distributions Subplots">
                    <div class="text">
                        <p class="description"> Figure 2: Distribution of Heart Features</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h6>We can see that the other attributes' distributions aren't balanced, which is to be
                        expected. As long as our response variable is balanced then we are safe to proceed. Notice that
                        our cholesterol distribution shows a high frequency for cholesterol levels under 50. While it
                        may look like an outlier, it is actually a sign of serious health complications such as heart
                        disease.</h6>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h6>Let's overlay the heart disease attribute on top of the distribution subplots to get an
                        understanding of which health indicators may cause heart disease.</h6>
                </div>
                <div class="project">

                </div>
                <div>
                    <h6>For most of these plots, we can tell that there is a clear divide between which health
                        conditions correlate with heart disease and which do not. For example, there is a higher risk of
                        heart disease for individuals with lower maximum heart rates than individuals with higher
                        maximum heart rates. This means it will be fairly easy to predict heart failure based on heart
                        features.</h6>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h6>We can further use a pairplot to create scatter subplots to visualize the distribution of heart
                        disease in relation to co-occurring health conditions.</h6>
                </div>
                <div class="project">

                </div>
                <div>
                    <h6>For example, we can see that there is more risk of heart disease as maximum heart rate drops.
                        We can also tell that younger individuals tend to have higher maximum heart rates than older
                        individuals. So, we can deduce that older individuals are more likely to get heart disease
                        because their maximum heart rate is low.</h6>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h6>Our pairplot also shows us that outliers, regardless of heart feature, usually signify heart
                        disease.</h6>
                </div>
                <h4>Modeling</h4>
                <div>
                    <h6>Since we have outliers in our dataset that we don't want to get rid of, we will avoid using
                        KNN and Naive Bayes, both which are sensitive to outliers. Random Forests, on the other hand,
                        are fairly robust to outliers and have excellent accuracy. While Decision Tree are also good at
                        handling outliers, they have a danger of overfitting. We need our model to accurately predict
                        new data. By using Random Forest, we are creating and averaging the results of an ensemble of
                        individual trees and thus reducing the chance of overfitting.

                        One of Random Forest's strengths is being able to accurately analyze data without needing much
                        pre-processing, which is why we will not need to scale and normalize the dataset. We can proceed
                        to use Scikit's OneHotEncoder to transform our categorical data into numeric data.

                <h4>Evaluation</h4>
                <div>
                    <h6>Let's take a look at the results of our Random Forest model:
                    </h6>
                </div>
                <div class="project">

                </div>
                <div>
                    <h6>
                        Our Random Forest model has an accuracy score of 88%, meaning that it is able to correctly
                        predict whether or not a person is at risk for heart disease 88% of the time. Looking at the confusion
                        matrix, this ratio translates to 162 correct predictions out of all the 184 predictions made.</h6>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h6>Given our context of predicting heart disease, where false negatives (predicting a person does
                        not have a risk of heart disease when they actually do) might have more serious consequences
                        than false positives (predicting a person has a risk of heart disease when they do not), the
                        metric we should prioritize is recall.

                        Recall measures the proportion of actual positive cases (people with risk of heart disease) that
                        are correctly predicted by the model. In other words, it measures the model's ability to find
                        all positive cases while avoiding false negatives. A higher recall indicates that the model is
                        better at identifying people with risk of heart disease and minimizing false negatives.

                        Our recall score tells us that our model correctly identifies all risk of heart disease cases
                        while avoiding false negatives 89% of the time. Out of our 107 predictions, 95 were correctly
                        classified as having a risk of heart disease while 12 were wrongly classified as not having a
                        risk of heart disease when really they do.
                    </h6>
                </div>
                <h4>Story Telling</h4>
                <div>
                    <h6>Let's go back to our original inquiry: Can we accurately predict who is at risk of heart disease
                        based off of their heart features? Our distribution subplots (Figure 3) made it easy to
                        visualize the probability of a person having a risk of heart disease based on the different
                        heart features. There was for the most part an understandable divide between the status of a
                        heart feature and if it showed risk of heart disease or not. This helps us feel more secure with
                        the accuracy of our model to make these predictions on its own.

                        Analyzing our model's evaluation metrics proved to us that there will always be a cost in
                        prediction, we just have to choose which one to prioritize. We chose to prioritize recall.
                        However, is an 88% recall score high enough to make our model reliable? Perhaps if we were
                        predicting rain, 88% would be enough, but we are predicting the risk of a serious health
                        complication in order to prevent it. What score is high enough to make the use of this model
                        ethical?
                    </h6>
                </div>
                <h4>Impact</h4>
                <div>
                    <h6>Using machine learning in the health field has brought along many advancements, but not without
                        the risks. Our model is used to make medical diagnoses, which is a very heavy task. A wrong
                        diagnosis can potentially kill someone. This is the reason we focused on maximizing true
                        positives while minimizing false negatives when assessing our model. For a health complication
                        as severe as heart disease, there is a high cost associated with false negatives, so it's
                        crucial to identify all positive cases. If our model fails to predict an individual's risk of
                        heart disease, they won't know to take the preventative measures needed. On the other hand,
                        having false alarms (identifying a person with heart disease risk when they don't have it) might
                        be tedious and timely to manually unravel, but it is an acceptable compromise given the
                        alternative. It is always better to be safe than too late.
