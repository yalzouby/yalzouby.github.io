        <h2>Project 1: Defining a Problem and Data Understanding</h2>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <div>
          <h6>Diamond rings, quite literally an investment, will bring you tears before joy. The average diamond ring is
            estimated at $6,000, but what qualities of a diamond give it its value and thus its price?
            The size of the stone is a well known contributor, but the four Cs are the major defining features of a
            diamond ring: color, cut, carat, and clarity.
            If I had a budget and wanted to maximize the value to price ratio of my diamond ring, I would like to know
            which of these qualities I should focus on over others. Which feature of a diamond raises its value (price) the most?</h6>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h6>For this analysis, I will be using the <a
              href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivam2503/diamonds">"Diamonds"</a> dataset from Kaggle, which
            features the prices, four Cs, and size (x, y, and z) attributes of nearly 54,000 diamonds.
            The price variable is numerical and in US Dollars. The carat variable, also numerical, is defined as the
            weight of the diamond and ranges from 0.2 to 5.01 with 5.01 being the heaviest.
            The cut of a diamond is measured by its quality: Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, and Ideal. The color of a
            diamond is ranked from J to D with D being the best.
            The clarity variable, defined by how clear a diamond is, is measured by another categorical system: I1
            (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best).</h6>
        </div>
        <h4>Pre-processing</h4>
        <div>
          <h6>I'll start off by making sure the dataset has no null or duplicated values. As I will be focusing on the
            cut, clarity, color, and carats of a diamond in this analysis, I will disregard and remove the depth and
            table variables.
            I will use the x, y and z variables to create a new feature, volume, which will replace the dimension
            features.
            The cut, clarity, and color are all variables with categorical values. For the sake of simplicity, I will be
            converting them to numerical values, with 1 representing the best values.</h6>
        </div>
        <h4>Data Understanding & Visualization</h4>
        <div class="project">
          <img src="images/DiamondsHeatmap.png" alt="Diamonds Heatmap">
          <div class="text">
            <p class="description"> Figure 1: Correlation of Diamond Attributes Heatmap</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h6>The simplest approach to visualizing this dataset is by using a heatmap. Implementing seaborn's heatmap
            allows us to map out the correlation between every variable in the dataset.
            Since we're only analyzing the four c's and the price of a diamond, we can see from the map that the carat
            of a diamond has the most impact on its price, with a 92% correlation.
            Color and clarity are a lot lower, at 17% and 15%. Cut has the lowest correlation at 5.3%.</h6>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h6>Let's take a closer look at each of these correlations.</h6>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
          <img src="images/DiamondsCutPriceJointplot.png" alt="Diamonds Cut-Price Jointplot">
          <div class="text">
            <p class="description"> Figure 2: Cut-Price Jointplot</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h6>Using seaborn's jointplot, we are able to visualize the relationship between the four c's and the price of
            a diamond.
            Even more, jointplot allows us to simultaneously observe the distribution of each variable. Unfortunately,
            our datatset is very dense and the datapoints overlap each other,
            making it difficult to see where the higher and lower concentrations truly are. A boxenplot could help
            improve the visualization, by showing the quartile values of each distribution while maintaining the shape
            of each distribution.
            For example, we can look at the boxenplot for cut and price.</h6>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
          <img src="images/DiamondsCutPriceBoxenplot.png" alt="Diamonds Cut-Price Boxenplot">
          <div class="text">
            <p class="description"> Figure 3: Cut-Price Boxenplot</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h6>Strangely enough, the average price of a diamond with an Ideal cut (1/best) is the lowest amongst the
            cuts, and the average price of a diamond with a Fair cut (5/worst) is the highest amongst the cuts. Why is
            that?
            Our jointplot earlier allowed us to see the count distribution of each cut, which was unbalanced. We can
            take another look using a countplot.</h6>
        </div>
        <div class="project">

          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h6>There are over 20,000 diamonds with an Ideal (1) cut and less than 2,500 diamonds with a Fair (5) cut.
            With such an unbalanced dataset, we cannot trust the visualization to be entirely accurate.</h6>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h6>The distribution of the clarity variable is similarly unbalanced.</h6>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h6>The distribution of the color variable is almost balanced.</h6>
        </div>

        </div>
        <div>
          <h6>If we disregard the two lowest colors on the scale (6 and 7), then we can see the average price of a
            diamond is highest for color 5 and nearly the same for the first four colors.</h6>

        </div>
        <div>
          <h6>While the distribution of the carat variable is also unbalanced, the data seems to be consistent enough
            for the correlation between carat and price to reflect logical implication.</h6>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
          <img src="images/DiamondsCaratPriceJointplot.png" alt="Diamonds Carat-Price Jointplot">

            <p class="description"> Figure 9: Carat-Price Jointplot</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h6>As carat increases, so does price. While the plot does begin to plateau after 1 carat,
            it is important to note that the distribution of carats in the dataset is right skewed,
            with insignificant density in carats over 2.5. Nevertheless, the few high carats are respectively plotted
            high in price, foreshadowing a stronger positive correlation if our dataset had a more balanced distribution for
            carat.</h6>
        </div>
        <h4>Story Telling</h4>
        <div>
          <h6>Let's go back to our original inquiry: Which feature of a diamond raises its value (price) the most? 
            Our dataset might be too imbalanced to have gathered a fair conclusion. 
            The plots show that diamonds with a lower color and cut have a higher price than diamonds with a higher color and cut. 
            Or perhaps, people who chose a lower cut or lower color also chose to splurge when it came to carat. 
            Most people only pay attention to carats when diamond shopping and don't know much about or don't care for the other features.
            This would align with our findings for the carat feature, which showed to have a positive correlation. 
            Both the heatmap (Figure 1) and Carat-Price jointplot (Figure 9) support this conclusion.
            The carat feature of a Diamond appears to raise its value (price) the most.

            unbalanced data, answered question?, partially?</h6>
        </div>
        <h4>Impact</h4>
        <div>
          <h6>It is very plausible that our conclusion is biased given our unbalanced dataset. 
            Our visualizations can also be misleading if there are confounding factors. 
            For example, cut and color appear like they cost more, but what if that's a co-ocurring high carat feature. 
            Our results might misdirect people to consider higher cuts and colors as cheaper options when in reality they're more expensive.</h6>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h6>Moving forward, we could try and find a solution for the imbalance of features in the dataset and then re-analyze the dataset.
            We might even have new questions arise from this analysis. 
            For example, how often will people who purchase a diamond with a high carat level opt for lower quality in color, cut, and clarity?</h6>
